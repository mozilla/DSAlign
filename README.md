# DSAlign
DeepSpeech based forced alignment tool

## Installation

It is recommended to use this tool from within a virtual environment.
There is a script for creating one with all requirements in the git-ignored dir `venv`:

```bash
$ bin/createenv.sh
$ ls venv
bin  include  lib  lib64  pyvenv.cfg  share
```

`bin/align.sh` will automatically use it.

## Prerequisites

### Language specific data

Internally DSAlign uses the [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/) STT engine.
For it to be able to function, it requires a couple of files that are specific to 
the language of the speech data you want to align.
If you want to align English, there is already a helper script that will download and prepare
all required data:

```bash
$ bin/getmodel.sh 
[...]
$ ls models/en/
alphabet.txt  lm.binary  output_graph.pb  output_graph.pbmm  output_graph.tflite  trie
```

### Dependencies for generating individual language models

If you plan to let the tool generate individual language models per text (you should!),
you have to get (essentially build) [KenLM](https://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/).
Before doing this, you should install its [dependencies](https://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/dependencies/).
For Debian based systems this can be done through:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libboost-all-dev cmake zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev liblzma-dev 
```

With all requirements fulfilled, there is a script for building and installing KenLM
and the required DeepSpeech tools in the right location:
```bash
$ bin/lm-dependencies.sh
```

If all went well, the alignment tool will find and use it to automatically create individual
language models for each document.

### Example data

There is also a script for downloading and preparing some public domain speech and transcript data.

```bash
$ bin/gettestdata.sh
$ ls data
test1  test2
```

## Using the tool

```bash
$ bin/align.sh --help
[...]
```

### Alignment using example data

```bash
$ bin/align.sh --output-max-cer 15 --loglevel 10 data/test1/audio.wav data/test1/transcript.txt data/test1/aligned.json
```

## The algorithm

### Step 1 - Splitting audio

A voice activity detector (at the moment this is `webrtcvad`) is used
to split the provided audio data into voice fragments.
These fragments are essentially streams of continuous speech without any longer pauses 
(e.g. sentences).

`--audio-vad-aggressiveness <AGGRESSIVENESS>` can be used to influence the length of the
resulting fragments.

### Step 2 - Preparation of original text

STT transcripts are typically provided in a normalized textual form with
- no casing,
- no punctuation and
- normalized whitespace (single spaces only).

So for being able to align STT transcripts with the original text it is necessary
to internally convert the original text into the same form.

This happens in two steps:
1. Normalization of whitespace, lower-casing all text and 
replacing some characters with spaces (e.g. dashes)
2. Removal of all characters that are not in the languages's alphabet
(see DeepSpeech model data)

Be aware: *This conversion happens on text basis and will not remove unspoken content
like markup/markdown tags or artifacts. This should be done beforehand.
Reducing the difference of spoken and original text will improve alignment quality and speed.*

In the very unlikely situation that you have to change the default behavior (of step 1),
there are some switches:

`--text-keep-dashes` will prevent substitution of dashes with spaces.

`--text-keep-ws` will keep whitespace untouched.

`--text-keep-casing` will keep character casing as provided.

### Step 4a (optional) - Generating document specific language model

If the [dependencies][Dependencies for generating individual language models] for 
individual language model generation got installed, this document-individual model will
now be generated by default.

Assuming your text document is named `original.txt`, these files will be generated:
- `original.txt.clean` - cleaned version of the original text
- `original.txt.arpa` - text file with probabilities in ARPA format
- `original.txt.lm` - binary representation of the former one
- `original.txt.trie` - prefix-tree optimized for probability lookup

`--stt-no-own-lm` deactivates creation of individual language models per document and
uses the one from model dir instead.

### Step 4b - Transcription of voice fragments through STT

After VAD splitting the resulting fragments are transcribed into textual phrases.
This transcription is done through [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/) STT.

As this can take a longer time, all resulting phrases are - together with their 
timestamps - saved as JSON into a transcription log file 
(the `audio` parameter path with suffix `.tlog` instead of `.wav`).
Consecutive calls will look for that file and - if found - 
load it and skip the transcription phase.

`--stt-model-dir <DIR>` points DeepSpeech to the language specific model data directory.
It defaults to `models/en`. Use `bin/getmodel.sh` for preparing it.  

### Step 5 - Rough alignment

The actual text alignment is based on a recursive divide and conquer approach:

1. Construct an ordered list of of all phrases in the current interval
(at the beginning this is the list of all phrases that are to be aligned),
where long phrases close to the middle of the interval come first.
2. Iterate through the list and compute the best Smith-Waterman alignment
(see the following sub-sections) with the document's original text...
3. ...till there is a phrase whose Smith-Waterman alignment score surpasses a (low) recursion-depth 
dependent threshold (in most cases this should already be the first phrase).
4. Recursively continue with step 1 for the sub-intervals and original text ranges
to the left and right of the phrase and its aligned text range within the original text.
5. Return all phrases in order of appearance (depth-first) that were aligned with the minimum 
Smith-Waterman score on their recursion level.

This approach assumes that all phrases were spoken in the same order as they appear in the
original transcript. It has the following advantages compared to individual
global phrase matching:

- Long non-matching chunks of spoken text or the original transcript will automatically and 
cleanly get ignored.
- Short phrases (with the risk of matching more than one time per document) will automatically
get aligned to their intended locations by longer ones who "squeeze" them in.
- Smith-Waterman score thresholds can be kept lower 
(and thus better match lower quality STT transcripts), as there is a lower chance for 
  - long sequences to match at a wrong location and for 
  - shorter sequences to match at a wrong location within their shortened intervals
  (as they are getting matched later and deeper in the recursion tree).

#### Smith-Waterman candidate selection

Finding the best match of a given phrase within the original (potentially long) transcript
using vanilla Smith-Waterman is not feasible.

So this tool follows a two-phase approach where the first goal is to get a list of alignment 
candidates. As the first step the original text is virtually partitioned into windows of the 
same length as the search pattern. These windows are ordered descending by the number of 3-grams
they share with the pattern.
Best alignment candidates are now taken from the beginning of this ordered list.

`--align-max-candidates <CANDIDATES>` sets the maximum number of candidate windows
taken from the beginning of the list for further alignment.

`--align-candidate-threshold <THRESHOLD>` multiplied with the number of 3-grams of the predecessor
window it gives the minimum number of 3-grams the next candidate window has to have to also be
considered a candidate.

#### Smith-Waterman alignment

For each candidate, the best possible alignment is computed using the 
[Smith-Waterman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm) algorithm
within an extended interval of one window-size around the candidate window.

`--align-match-score <SCORE>` is the score per correctly matched character. Default: 100

`--align-mismatch-score <SCORE>` is the score per non-matching (exchanged) character. Default: -100

`--align-gap-score <SCORE>` is the score per character gap (removing 1 character from pattern or original). Default: -100

The overall best score for the best match is normalized to a value of about 100 maximum by dividing
it through the maximum character count of either the match or the pattern.

During the output step this score can then be used for filtering (abbreviated as `sws`).

### Step 6 - Gap alignment

After recursive matching of fragments there are potential text leftovers between aligned original
texts.

Some examples:
- Often: Missing (and therefore unaligned) STT transcripts of word-endings (e.g. English past tense endings _-d_ and _-ed_)
on phrase endings to the left of the gap
- Seldom: Phrase beginnings or endings that were wrongly matched on unspoken (but written) text whose actual
alignments are now left unaligned in the gap
- Big unmatched chunks of text, like
  - Preface, text summaries or any other kind of meta information
  - Copyright headers/footers
  - Table of contents
- Chapter headers (if not spoken as they appear)
- Captions of figures
- Contents of tables
- Line-headers like character names in drama scripts
- Dependent of the (pre-processing) quality: OCR leftovers like
  - page headers
  - page numbers
  - reader's notes
  
The basic challenge here is to figure out, if all or some of the gap text should be used to extend 
the phrase to the left and/or to the right of the gap.

As Smith-Waterman alignment led to the current (potentially incomplete or even wrong) result,
its score cannot be used for further fine-tuning.
Instead the tool uses a score that is computed as the sum of the number of weighted shared N-grams.
It ensures that:
- Shared N-gram instances near interval bounds (dependent on situation) get rated higher than
the ones near the center or opposite end
- Large shared N-gram instances are weighted higher than short ones

`--align-min-ngram-size <SIZE>` sets the start (minimum) N-gram size

`--align-max-ngram-size <SIZE>` sets the final (maximum) N-gram size

`--align-ngram-size-factor <FACTOR>` sets a weight factor for the size preference

`--align-ngram-position-factor <FACTOR>` sets a weight factor for the position preference

During the output step this score can also be used for filtering (abbreviated as `wng`).

Using this score, the gap alignment is done by looking for the best scoring extension
of the left and right phrases up to their maximum extension.

`--align-stretch-factor <FRACTION>` is the fraction of the text length that it could get
stretched at max.  

For many languages it is worth putting some emphasis on matching to words boundaries 
(that is white-space separated sub-sequences).

`--align-snap-factor <FACTOR>` allows to control the snappiness to word boundaries.

If the best scoring extensions should overlap, the best scoring sum of non-overlapping
(but touching) extensions will win.

### Step 7 - Selection, filtering and output

Finally the best alignment of all candidate windows is selected as the winner.
It has to survive a series of filters for getting into the result file:

`--output-min-tlen <LENGTH>` only accepts samples having STT transcripts of the
provided minimum character length
                              
`--output-max-tlen <LENGTH>` only accepts samples having STT transcripts of the
provided maximum character length

`--output-min-mlen <LENGTH>` only accepts samples having matching original transcripts of the
provided minimum character length
                              
`--output-max-mlen <LENGTH>` only accepts samples having matching original transcripts of the
provided maximum character length 

`--output-min-sws <SWS>` only accepts samples whose STT transcripts have the provided minimum
Smith-Waterman score when compared to best matching original transcript

`--output-max-sws <SWS>` only accepts samples whose STT transcripts have the provided maximum
Smith-Waterman score when compared to best matching original transcript

`--output-min-wng <WNG>` only accepts samples whose STT transcripts have the provided minimum
weighted N-gram score when compared to best matching original transcript

`--output-max-wng <WNG>` only accepts samples whose STT transcripts have the provided maximum
weighted N-gram score when compared to best matching original transcript

`--output-min-cer <CER>` only accepts samples whose STT transcripts have the provided minimum
character error rate when compared to best matching original transcript

`--output-max-cer <CER>` only accepts samples whose STT transcripts have the provided maximum
character error rate when compared to best matching original transcript

`--output-min-wer <WER>` only accepts samples whose STT transcripts have the provided minimum
word error rate when compared to the best matching original transcript

`--output-max-wer <WER>` only accepts samples whose STT transcripts have the provided maximum
word error rate when compared to the best matching original transcript

All result samples are written to a JSON result file of the form:
```javascript
[
  {
    "start": 8646120,
    "end": 8647440,
    "text-start": 127949,
    "text-end": 127967,
    "transcript": "this was a test",
    "aligned": "this has a test",
    "aligned-raw": "This has a test."
  },
  //...
]
```

Each object array-entry represents a matched audio fragment with the following attributes:
- `start`: Time offset of the audio fragment in milliseconds from the beginning of the
aligned audio file
- `end`: Time offset of the audio fragment's end in milliseconds from the beginning of the
aligned audio file
- `text-start`: Character offset of the fragment's associated original text within the
aligned text document
- `text-end`: Character offset of the end of the fragment's associated original text within the
aligned text document
- `transcript`: The STT transcript used for aligning
- `aligned`: The __clean__ original text fragment that got aligned with the audio fragment
and its STT transcript
- `aligned-raw`: The __raw__ original text fragment that got aligned with the audio fragment
and its STT transcript

`--output-tlen` adds length of STT transcript as attribute `tlen` to array-entry

`--output-mlen` adds length of matching original transcript as attribute `mlen` to array-entry

`--output-sws` adds Smith-Waterman score
(of STT transcript compared to matching original transcript) as attribute `sws` to array-entry

`--output-wng` adds weighted N-gram score
(of STT transcript compared to matching original transcript) as attribute `wng` to array-entry

`--output-cer` adds character error rate
(of STT transcript compared to matching original transcript) as attribute `cer` to array-entry

`--output-wer` adds word error rate
(of STT transcript compared to matching original transcript) as attribute `wer` to array-entry

Error rates and scores are provided as fractional values (typically between 0.0 = 0% and 1.0 = 100%
where numbers >1.0 are theoretically possible).

## General options
